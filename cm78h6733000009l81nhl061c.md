It is true that there’s a lot to learn about Python as it is uniquely different from other programming language. It can be used on a server to create web applications - [check out my recent article on web applications](https://oyoenisaiaa.hashnode.dev/from-frontend-magic-to-backend-expertise-a-full-stack-developers-story).

I am getting trained to be certified as a backend developer so I have been learning a lot about Python’s data types and their characteristics. I have been inspired to write this article by a recent project where I am creating an ATM simulator, so this article will discuss Python’s concepts and uses.

## A Beginner’s Journey Through Python’s Core Concepts and Best Practices

### Quick tips

* In addition to web development (server-side), Python can also be used for software development, creating workflows, and script writing.
    
* It can handle large data and complex mathematics, connect to database, read and modify files.
    
* Compared to other programming languages, Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
    

> If you’re like me who is very structured and love to break down and explain codes clearly in comments, this tip is a life saver.

* In Python, a variable name cannot be any of the [Python keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).
    
* Python really relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages use curly-brackets for this purpose.
    
* Comments in Python are represented by # for short or single line comments, and they can be placed at the top or beside a code line. You can also insert # for multiple lines of comments or use open and closed multiple strings since there would be no variable assigned to it, Python will ignore this block of string literals. Below are the different ways to use comments in Python:
    
    1. **Single-line comments** using `#`
        
    2. **Inline comments** after a statement
        
    3. **Multi-line comments** using multiple `#`
        
    4. **Docstring-style comments** using triple quotes (`""" """` or `''' '''`), though typically used for documentation. Hence, docstrings can be accessed at runtime using `help()` or `__doc__`. Find below the difference between comments and docstrings:
        
        | **Feature** | **Comments (**`#`**)** | **Docstrings (**`""" """`**)** |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Purpose | Explain code for developers | Describe the purpose of modules, functions, and classes |
        | Visibility | Ignored by Python | Can be accessed at runtime using `help()` |
        | Placement | Anywhere in code | Typically at the start of functions, classes, or modules |
        
        ```python
        # This is a single-line comment
        print("Welcome to International Bank!")
        
        print("Welcome to International Bank!")  # This is an inline comment
        
        # This is a comment
        # written in
        # more than just one line
        print("Welcome to International Bank!")
        
        """
        This is a comment
        written in
        more than just one line
        """
        print("Welcome to International Bank!")
        ```

## Variables in Python

A **variable** is a name that stores a value in memory. In Python, you don’t need to declare a variable type explicitly; the type is inferred based on the assigned value.

### **Rules for Naming Variables**

1. Must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (\_).
    
2. Cannot start with a number.
    
3. Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores and Python allows assigning multiple values to multiple variables in one line.
    
4. Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different variables).
    
5. Cannot use Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `while`, `import`).
    

**Legal variable naming:**

<mark>myvar</mark> = "John"  
<mark>my_var</mark> = "John"  
<mark>_my_var </mark> \= "John"  
<mark>myVar</mark> = "John"  
<mark>MYVAR</mark> = "John"  
<mark>myvar2</mark> = "John"

---

### **Declaring and Assigning Variables**

```python
name = "Alice"   # String
age = 15            # Integer
accountBalance = 1500.75   # Float
is_active = True    # Boolean

print(name, age, accountBalance, is_active)
```

---

### **Multiple Assignments**

Python allows assigning multiple values to multiple variables in one line.

```python
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

Assigning the same value to multiple variables:

```python
a = b = c = "Python"
print(a, b, c)
```

---

### **Type Checking**

To check the type of a variable, use `type()`.

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

---

### **Dynamic Typing**

Python is dynamically typed, meaning you can change the type of a variable by reassigning it.

```python
var = 10    # Initially an integer
var = "Now a string"  # Reassigned as a string
print(var)
```

---

### **Variable Scope**

* **Global Variable**: Accessible throughout the script. It can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
    
* **Local Variable**: Defined inside a function and only accessible there.
    

```python
global_var = "Greetings - Welcome to International Bannk"

def my_function():
    local_var = "Transaction - Account balance"
    print(local_var)

my_function()
print(global_var)
```

However, you can create a global variable inside a function by using the `global` keyword. Also, use the `global` keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.

## Data Types

One of the important concepts of Python is its **data type**. When you have a variable and assign a data or value to it, it is important to know what data type is required for that function. This determines the output and the overall performance of your code.

Python has several built-in data types that define the kind of values a variable can hold:

Below is a summary table and a breakdown of the most common ones with examples of them being assigned to a variable:

### **Summary Table**

| **Types** | **Category** |
| --- | --- |
| Numeric | `int`, `float`, `complex` |
| Sequence | `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `range` |
| Set | `set`, `frozenset` |
| Mapping | `dict` |
| Boolean | `bool` |
| Binary | `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview` |
| None | `NoneType` |

### **Breakdown**

**Numeric Types**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | Integer values (whole numbers) | `x = 10` |
| `float` | Decimal numbers | `y = 10.5` |
| `complex` | Complex numbers with `j` as the imaginary part | `z = 2 + 3j` |

```python
x = 10         # Integer
y = 10.5       # Float
z = 2 + 3j     # Complex
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))
```

---

**Sequence Types**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `str` | String (text) | `name = "International Bank"` |
| `list` | Ordered, mutable collection | `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` |
| `tuple` | Ordered, immutable collection | `coordinates = (10, 20, 30)` |
| `range` | Sequence of numbers | `numbers = range(5)` (0 to 4) |

```python
name = "International Bank"   # String
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # List
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)  # Tuple
numbers = range(5)  # Range

print(type(name), type(fruits), type(coordinates), type(numbers))
```

---

**Set Types**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set` | Unordered, unique collection | `unique_nums = {1, 2, 3, 3}` |
| `frozenset` | Immutable version of a set | `frozen_nums = frozenset({1, 2, 3})` |

```python
unique_nums = {1, 2, 3, 3}  # Set (removes duplicate)
frozen_nums = frozenset({1, 2, 3})  # Frozenset (immutable)

print(type(unique_nums), type(frozen_nums))
```

---

**Mapping Type**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dict` | Key-value pairs | `user = {"name": "John", "age": 30}` |

```python
customer = {"name": "Alice Johnson", "account_no": "1234567890", "pin": "1234", "balance": 5000.75}  # Dictionary
print(type(customer))
```

---

**Boolean Type**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bool` | Represents `True` or `False` | `is_active = True` |

```python
is_active = True  # Boolean
print(type(is_active))
```

---

**Binary Types**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bytes` | Immutable sequence of bytes | `b = b"Hello"` |
| `bytearray` | Mutable sequence of bytes | `ba = bytearray(5)` |
| `memoryview` | View of a bytes object | `mv = memoryview(bytes(5))` |

```python
b = b"Hello"  # Bytes
ba = bytearray(5)  # Bytearray
mv = memoryview(bytes(5))  # Memoryview

print(type(b), type(ba), type(mv))
```

---

**None Type**

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NoneType` | Represents no value | `x = None` |

```python
x = None  # NoneType
print(type(x))
```

### **Collections in Python**

Collections in Python are specialized data types used to store multiple values in a single variable. The four main collection types are:

1. **List** – Ordered, mutable (changeable), allows duplicates.
    
2. **Tuple** – Ordered, immutable (unchangeable), allows duplicates.
    
3. **Set** – Unordered, mutable, does not allow duplicates.
    
4. **Dictionary** – Key-value pairs, unordered (in Python 3.6 and below), mutable.
    

If you have a collection of values in any of the above collection types, Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called *unpacking*.

I find Tuple as an interesting data type, not just its difference between list in their appearance but also in its unpacking nature. When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple but, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking".

**Basic Unpacking**

Tuple unpacking allows us to assign multiple values from a tuple to variables in a single line.

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green, yellow, red) = fruits  # Unpacking tuple values into variables

print(green)   # Output: apple
print(yellow)  # Output: banana
print(red)     # Output: cherry
```

However, If there are more values than variables, you can use `*` to collect the remaining values into a list.

**Unpacking with** `*` (Assigning Remaining Values to a List)

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits  # Assigns first two values to variables, rest to "red"

print(green)  # Output: apple
print(yellow) # Output: banana
print(red)    # Output: ['cherry', 'strawberry', 'raspberry']  # Rest assigned as a list
```

**Unpacking When** `*` **is Not the Last Variable**

If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left.

```python
fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")

(green, *tropic, red) = fruits  # First value goes to "green", last to "red", rest to "tropic"

print(green)  # Output: apple
print(tropic) # Output: ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple']
print(red)    # Output: cherry
```

You can iterate through a tuple using loops, join two tuples using the `+` operator, and you can repeat a tuple’s elements using the `*` operator.
