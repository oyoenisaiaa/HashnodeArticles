I had just finished university and was uncertain about where my career would lead. One thing I was sure of, however, was my experience in the world of IT. I enrolled in summer computer classes and soon had an opportunity to work with MBM Machines, a leading distributor of Dell Machines in Nigeria. It was exciting to discover so much about machines. While I enjoyed business meetings, what I loved the most was heading down to the tech team‚Äôs workspace to uncover a motherboard, learn its parts, and assemble and disassemble them.

After the national youth service corps, my path changed because I found a job in the Marketing field, nonetheless in IT and Satellite communication companies so my tech learnings continued with so much passion and dedication. I grew a portfolio of many OEM services and products of Fortune 500 companies across West, East and Southern Africa, positioning and promoting while understanding how their technology works. I have used many business and marketing tools and over the years, would wish for some changes as a user. The need to resolve this increased my desire to learn what goes on behind the scenes, I was interested to learn how programs and tools are coded for users. Africa Agility was a great fit for me.

After completing the National Youth Service Corps, my career path took a turn as I found a job in marketing. Nonetheless, it was still within IT companies, so my tech learning continued with passion and dedication. Over time, I built a portfolio of various OEM services and products of Fortune 500 companies across West, East, and Southern Africa. While positioning and promoting these products, I developed a deep understanding of how their technology worked. I frequently wished for changes in business and marketing tools, which piqued my curiosity about what happens behind the scenes - how programs and tools are coded for users. That curiosity led me to programming.

## **Modern Web Development**

The first programming language I learned was C, but it wasn‚Äôt a great fit for me at the time. I often felt lost, and the bootcamp‚Äôs learning format didn‚Äôt suit my style. Thankfully, I found Africa Agility Foundation, which turned out to be a perfect match.

I signed up for the sponsored Girls-in-Tech program under the Front-End Development track, and it was phenomenal. As I built blocks of code and saw the output, I could relate it to the campaigns I had created in my marketing world. Web development, I realized, is the backbone of the internet, shaping everything from simple blogs to complex applications. But what exactly goes into building a functional, user-friendly website? Let‚Äôs explore the core concepts.

## **The Building Blocks of the Web**

At its core, web development is divided into three main layers:

### **Frontend (Client-Side Development)**

The frontend is what users interact with directly. It includes,

* **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The structure of a webpage. I call it ***<mark>"The Architect"</mark>*** *üèóÔ∏è* `<html></html>`
    
* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Adds style and enhances visual appeal. ***<mark>"The Designer"</mark>*** *‚ú®*
    
    This can be done:
    
    ‚Üí externally `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`,
    
    ‚Üí internally styled within the head of the page `<style></style>` or
    
    ‚Üí as an inline style for small changes inside the HTML elements `<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>`
    
* **JavaScript:** Brings life to the page with animations, interactivity, dynamic content and real-time updates - like magic! ***<mark>‚ÄúThe Magician"</mark>***<mark>üé©</mark>ü™Ñ
    
    This can also be done:
    
    ‚Üí externally before `</body>` to improve performance, `<script src="script.js"></script>`,
    
    ‚Üí internally as a `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` or before `</body>` or
    
    ‚Üí inline as an `onclick` attribute (not recommended for larger projects), `<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click me</button>`
    

**Example:** When you visit a website, the layout, colors, fonts, and animations are all part of the frontend, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### **Backend (Server-Side Development)**

The backend is responsible for handling requests, storing data, and ensuring smooth functionality. It can‚Äôt be seen or interacted with by the users and consists of:

* **Server:** Processing requests (e.g., Node.js, Express, Django, or Ruby on Rails).
    
* **Database:** Stores user data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    
* **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** Connecting frontend to backend.
    

**Example:** When you log in to an e-commerce site, the backend checks and verifies your credentials, fetches order details, and displays them on your dashboard.

#### Fun facts about back-end development that you might enjoy!

1. ***The First Back-End Code Was Written in the 1950s:*** *Before websites, back-end programming powered early computers! The first known back-end languages included Assembly and COBOL.*
    
2. ***Servers Are Like Secret Keepers:*** *The back-end stores passwords, personal data, and business logic - things users never see but rely on every day.*
    
3. ***APIs Are Like Waiters in a Restaurant:*** *APIs work like waiters - taking requests from users (front-end) and fetching the right information from the kitchen (back-end/database).*
    
4. ***Back-End Code Can Run for Years Without Updates:*** *Unlike front-end design trends, some back-end code stays* unchanged for decades, running on old servers *that still do the job!*
    
5. ***The Internet Runs on Open-Source Back-End Tech:*** *Many back-end technologies like* Linux, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and Apache are open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to improving them.
    
6. ***Back-End Developers Sometimes Call Databases ‚ÄúThe Fridge‚Äù:*** *Since databases store everything, some developers call them "the fridge" - but if you don‚Äôt organize it well, it gets messy!*
    
7. ***Error Codes Have Hidden Meanings:***
    
    * ***404 (Not Found)*** *‚Üí A missing page*
        
    * ***500 (Internal Server Error)*** *‚Üí The back-end is confused*
        
    * ***418 (I'm a Teapot)*** *‚Üí A joke error created in 1998 for April Fool‚Äôs!*
        
8. ***The "Cloud" Is Just Someone Else‚Äôs Computer:*** *When you store files in "the cloud," they actually live on remote back-end servers maintained by companies like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.*
    
9. ***The World's First Website Is Still Online:*** *Tim Berners-Lee created the first website in 1991, and you can still visit it:* [*http://info.cern.ch*](http://info.cern.ch)*. It had no CSS or JavaScript - just pure HTML!*
    
10. ***Back-End Developers Love Dark Mode:*** *Most back-end developers* *prefer dark mode on their editors, it‚Äôs easier on the eyes when working long hours!*

### **Full-Stack Development**

In a layered web development architecture, full-stack development acts as the bridge that connects all layers. Full-stack developers work on both the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless integration between them. They manage APIs, optimize performance, and oversee data flows.

**Hosting & Deployment**

Websites are made accessible to users through platforms like AWS, Vercel, or DigitalOcean. Hosting and deployment fall under the Infrastructure Layer of web development, which is responsible for making a website accessible to users worldwide and it runs smoothly on the internet. The key components are,

* **Web Hosting**: Stores website files (e.g., shared hosting, cloud hosting, serverless deployment).
    
* **Domain & DNS Management**: Connects a website to a URL.
    
* **Deployment Methods**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions, Vercel.
    
* **Security & Performance**: SSL certificates, caching, and load balancing optimize the site.
